    <h1>Joshua Bairds Report</h1>
    <h2>Client</h2>
    <a href="https://corobr.github.io/wdd130-baird/" target="_blank">Halveth</a>
    <h3>How did you decide what content and images to use for your site plan?</h3>
    <p>Well, I was doing a site for a world that I have been building. As such there were no images for this world as it
        is unique. So I went to AI and prompted it to generate the images that I wanted. That was the most time
        consuming part if making the whole site plan for me.</p>
    <h3>How did you communicate with your developer? Was there any issues with communication?</h3>
    <p>I did't have a ton of contact. We talked during class a few times which was actually more than enough. We also
        exchanged emails, and he sent me the live link, so I was able to keep up on the site. Other than that we didn't
        communicate very much, but I think we did all that was needed</p>
    <h3>Did your developer meet your expectations for your site?</h3>
    <p>Overall I think he did really well. The site looks great and I am very happy with how it turned out.</p>
    <h3>What will you do differently next time you hire a team to do a project for you?</h3>
    <p>I would have a meeting with the team (or just the lead dev) about the vision of the website, so He can catch what
        it is supposed to be. Then I would talk to him about not stifling his creativity. If he has an idea, try it and
        run it passed me! That would lead to a better site I think</p>
    <h2>Lead Dev</h2>

    <h3>How did you manage your development team and comunicate the tasks for your junior devs?</h3>
    <p>I could have done better there. I ended up not really managing very munch. I put it all on git hub, invited them,
        and then turned em loose. I probably should have done some things like assigning which junior dev did which
        page, but honestly with everything that was going on I didn't end up doing that.</p>
    <h3>How did you communicate with your client? Was there any issues?</h3>
    <p>Almost all of our communication came in class. I tried once to email him, but he never responded, so I just stuck
        to in person communication. there were some issues, as the wirframe he gave me had a hamburger nav, which we
        can't do without javascript. But all in all it worked out.</p>
    <h3>How did you handle publishing your clients site and sharing it with the client?</h3>
    <p>That was really simpele. I just put it on github, copied the link and sent it to the client. That was probably
        the easiest part of the whole thing.</p>
    <h3>How was your experience with managing your site with GitHub?</h3>
    <p>That was a lot actually. I wish that I had had more expiriance with github before this project. It felt like I
        was trying to learn something completely new right at the end of class which was unfortunate. But it worked out
        and it is pretty simple to use, so no big deal.</p>
    <h2>Junior Dev</h2>

    <h3>How did you communicate with your team lead? Was there any issues?</h3>
    <p>I didn't really communicate with them. Well thats not completely true, I talked with them once or twice about
        spacific issues, but all in all it was fine. One of my team leads seemed to not be following the wireframe of
        the client exactly, so I talked with him about it. then I just did my page and called it a day.</p>
    <h3>Did you know what was expected of you for each site?</h3>
    <p>Yeah that was pretty clear. Sometimes it was a bit confusing, but I just worked it out with the lead dev.</p>
    <h3>Were you able to contribute to your sites?</h3>
    <p>Yeah I always felt that I made a meaningful contribution. With one site that I was working on both child pages
        had basically the same CSS, but luckily I got there first so I was able to write that myself.</p>
    <h3>Did you run into any issues with GitHub and adding your changes to the sites?</h3>
    <p>Yeah there were a couple merge conflics which were a but stressful. I wish that we had been taught how to
        navigate that.</p>
    <h2>General</h2>
    <h3>What was the most challenging part of this project for you? Were you able to overcome it?</h3>
    <p>The most chalanging part of this projects was probably the creation of the site plan that I sent to the other dev
        team. It was tought to come up with the entire website without being able to see it clearly. Luckily I chose a
        topic that was really interesting to me. That helped me have the modivation to make it good.</p>
    <h3>What did you enjoy most about this project?</h3>
    <p>I enjoyed the finished product of my website the most. I love that I now have a website that introduces my world.
    </p>
    <h3>What would you do differently if you could do the project again?</h3>
    <p>I would do a bit more communication with my team and client. That would lead to less confution I think.</p>
    <h3>Do you feel more confident in working on real-world projects after this experience? Explain.</h3>
    <p>Absolutly! I now know how to use git to work on the same project together with somone! I think that is the
        biggest skill I learned.</p>
